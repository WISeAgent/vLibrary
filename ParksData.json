If you can drag them away from “just 1 more tipping bucket & slide mum!”, long enough to have a bite to eat cooked on our free BBQs in the camp kitchen, they can then hire go-karts to race around the park or canoes to explore the large Saltwatwer Lagoon at the back of the park.\nEnjoy the fact that we are surrounded by National Park so you have the feel of camping in nature, but with friendly staff and all the clean & well maintained facilities that you would expect from a resort to ensure your stay with us is five star.",
